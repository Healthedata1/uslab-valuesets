The combined result code provides a mechanism to transmit results that are associated with two or more orders.

The parent (PA) and child (CH) order control codes allow the spawning of &quot;child&quot; orders from a &quot;parent&quot; order without changing the parent (original order). One or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of PA are followed by one or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of CH. Whether OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag.   For example, suppose that a microbiology culture produced two organisms and corresponding susceptibility reports. Then the sequence of segments would be as follows: (see figure 4-4)  The assignment of placer order numbers in the parent-child paradigm depends on whether the placer or filler creates the child order and in the latter case, on whether the placer supports the SN/NA transaction. If the placer creates the child orders it will assign their placer order numbers according to its usual procedures. If the filler creates the child orders there are two possibilities: each child will inherit the placer order number of its parent, or the filler will use the SN/NA transaction to request that the placer assign a placer order number. In either case, the filler application creates the filler order numbers of the children according to its usual procedures.  Whenever a child order is transmitted in a message the ORC segment's ORC-8-parent is valued with the parent's filler order number (if originating from the filler) and with the parent's placer order number (if originating from the filler or if originating from the placer).   The parent-child mechanism can be used to &quot;expand&quot; a parent order (e.g., an order for three EKGs on successive mornings)." DisplayName="Parent order/service" Usage="E" Value="PA"/>

The observations-to-follow code is used to transmit patient-specific information with an order. An order detail segment (e.g., OBR) can be followed by one or more observation segments (OBX). Any observation that can be transmitted in an ORU message can be transmitted with this mechanism. When results are transmitted with an order, the results should immediately follow the order or orders that they support. - MORE DETAIL IN pdf
In this version of HL7, results can be transmitted with an order as one or more OBX segments without the necessity of including the ORC and OBR segments.  Observations can be transmitted in an ORU message without using an ORC. There are times when it is necessary to transmit information not included in the OBR segments of the ORU message. In this case, it is recommended that the ORC be included in the ORU message.  The order control value of RE is required only in ORM messages to indicate that an order is followed by observation results (OBX). The RE code is not necessary in the ORU message because it is expected that the OBR segments can be followed by observation results (OBX).

A replacement is the substitution of one or more orders for one or more previously ordered services.  The replaced orders are treated as though they were canceled. If and when an ordered service can be replaced are local site-specific determinations.  Use the parent/child order control codes if the site specifies that the original order must remain intact. Do not use the replacement codes under this circumstance.   For each order to be replaced, use an ORC-1-order control value of RP (request for a replacement going to a filler) or RU (an unsolicited replacement created by the filler) used by the filler to notify the placer and/or other systems). By local agreement, the ORC segment (with RP or RU) may be followed by its original order detail segment. The ORC segments (with RP or RU) must be followed by an ORC segment with an ORC-1-order control value of RO (indicating the replacement order).
